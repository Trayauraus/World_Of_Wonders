## Origins
The project originally started on [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/) as *Land of Tales* and then moved to *Land of Wonders* before being rebranded to World of Wonders to create the "WoW" acronym.
It is meant to be a passion project I can work on in my free time.
